          <head>GETTING STARTED WITH YOUR ENCODING PROJECT</head>
          <div>
          <p>This is a brief set of instructions which should help get you started
            in encoding your play.</p></div>
          
          <div>
            <head>A. CREATE YOUR XML PLAY FILE</head>
            
            <p>This is easy:</p>
            
            <list rend="numbered">
              <item>Make sure this file (instructions.xml) is open in Oxygen, and 
              you're looking at it.</item>
              <item>Press the red triangle button you see on the Oxygen toolbar.</item>
              <item>When asked, provide an id for your file. This must be in a format suitable for
              an @xml:id attribute, so: <list rend="bulleted">
              <item>it must begin with a letter</item>
              <item>it must not contain spaces or punctuation</item>
              <item>it should be short but distinctive</item>
              <item>lower-case is preferred</item>
              </list> Examples: <list rend="bulleted">
              <item>h8 (for Henry VIII)</item>
              <item>iyknmykn (If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody)</item>
              <item>rt (The Revengers Tragedy)</item>
              </list> <p> <emph>Now type your id here:</emph> <idno xml:id="playId"
              >yourPlayId</idno> </p> </item>
              <item>When asked, provide a short (modern) title for the play. This will 
              be used as the title in the play metadata.
              <p>
              <emph>Type the title of the play here:</emph> <idno xml:id="playTitle">Your Play Title</idno>
              </p>
              </item>
              <item>A new file should be created for you, with a filename based
                on the @xml:id. Open that file and you can begin editing.</item>
            </list>
          </div>
          <div>
            <head>B. CREATE YOUR LIST OF CHARACTERS</head>
            <p>The next stage is to construct a character list in the header of the 
            file you have created. The reason this has to be done first is that when 
            you come to mark up speeches in the play, each speech will be associated
            with one or more characters, and the character ids must be available so that 
            you can do that.</p>
